It fixes a number of issues in earlier Java versions, a model that is not too different from C, C++, C#, and so on.  As he pointed out, everyone seems to be getting along fine before the analysis, did we really miss that much?  (Yes)  What were we missing?

I'd like to describe a technique that I believe will identify if it is <em>possible</em> for the code to generate a string calls that violate the system rules.

In this entry and the next, I will discuss how to I specify the rules of proper code execution, and how the specification is changed into mechanical checks.  This time I will discuss how to check boundary conditions, with an approach that is very similar to design by contract. <a href="20.html"><i>read more...</i></a></td></tr><tr><td valign=top class="t1" align=right>Friday</td><th valign=top class="t1">2010<br>June 4</th><td valign=top class="t1"><a href="19.html"><b>Monitoring the code execution</b></a><br>

I mentioned in the <a href="16.html">previous entry</a> that I would describe how I wrote an emulation of an embedded system (and in the future, I intend to explain how I wrote simulations).  I wanted to write the simulation for a number of reasons.  To explore language semantics, to explore parsing, to explore ideas in testing, and debugging.  And, to allow development of embedded systems when I didn't have all of the hardware ready. <a href="17.html"><i>read more...</i></a></td></tr><tr><td valign=top class="t1" align=right>Sunday</td><th valign=top class="t1">2010<br>May 30</th><td valign=top class="t1"><a href="16.html"><b>Emulators and simulators</b></a><br>
In the land of embedded systems development, it is broadly accepted that you should have an emulator.  You do not need one with some simple systems, but you will find it hard to debug the design (hardware and software) without one.  Most people often use an ICE (an in-circuit-emulator) or the debug port on a micro-controller.  You can also use a simulator.  In this entry, I will outline the kinds of tools available, and their distinction. <a href="16.html"><i>read more...</i></a></td></tr><tr><td valign=top class="t1" align=right>Wednesday</td><th valign=top class="t1">2010<br>May 26</th><td valign=top class="t1"><a href="15.html"><b>Estimating the maximum time spent in an interrupt service routine.</b></a><br>
In design and development of software, I want to know what the worst-case, longest execution time for the interrupt service routine.  Not what we specified or intended in design; rather what the compiler created.  This is important because we want to be sure that we have plenty of time to spare: we don't want to miss other interrupts, or important hardware events that are signalled, and so forth.  And we don't want the ISR to be an infinite loop. <a href="15.html"><i>read more...</i></a></td></tr><tr><td valign=top class="t1" align=right>Tuesday</td><th valign=top class="t1">2010<br>May 25</th><td valign=top class="t1"><a href="14.html"><b>Cracker Barrel: Reconstructing Position</b></a><br>
In the summer of 1990 I started as a student assistant for an oceanographer at the University of Washington's Applied Physics Lab.  Somewhere along the way I was given a task to reconstruct where on earth (literally) a measurement was taken.  I was given a few different tapes, and copies of handwritten logs.  From there I
tried to estimating position of measurements based on these different sources: the ships logs, recordings from the navigation equipment, the sensor itself, and so on. <a href="14.html"><i>read more...</i></a></td></tr><tr><td valign=top class="t1" align=right>Sunday</td><th valign=top class="t1">2010<br>May 23</th><td valign=top class="t1"><a href="13.html"><b>Addressing Misconceptions: On computers, Countable and Floating point numbers are not associative nor distributive</b></a><br>

C (for example) has five kinds of looping constructs: <code>for</code>, <code>while</code>, <code>do while</code>, <code>goto</code>, and recursion.   I'll skip the last two, since they lack bounds check (the programmer has to insert a stop).
